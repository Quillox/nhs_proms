# Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs)
Exploratory Data Analysis of Patient Reported Outcome Measures from National Health Service data

## Contents

The python scripts are for processing the raw data found [here](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/patient-reported-outcome-measures-proms). Download all of the "finalised" reports, and place all of the files in the same folder.

The Jupyter notebook contains an initial EDA of the processed dataset.

The .pdf files contain information on the PROMs data, and a summary of the jupyter notebook.
